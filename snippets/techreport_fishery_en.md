The fishery for haddock in 5a has not changed substantially in recent years, but the total number of boats that account for 95% of the fishery has been declining steadily (@fig-numvesselplot and table 1). Around 250 longliners annually report catches of haddock, around 60 trawlers and 40 demersal seine boats. Most of Haddock in 5a is caught by trawlers and the proportion caught by that gear has decreased since 1995 from around 70% to 45% in 2017. However, for the last two years this proportion has increased slightly and is now around 60%. At the same time the proportion caught by longlines has increased from around 15% in 1995 - 2000 to 40 % in 2011--`r tyr-1`. Catches in demersal seine have varied less and have been at around 15% of Icelandic catches of Haddock in 5a. Currently less than 2% of catches are taken by other vessel types, but historically up to 10 % of total catches were by gillnetters, but since 2000 these catches have been low (@fig-landingsbygear). Most of the haddock caught in 5a by Icelandic vessels is caught at depths less than 200 m (@fig-depthplot). The main fishing grounds for Haddock in 5a, as observed from logbooks, are in the south, southwestern and western part of the Icelandic shelf (@fig-catchbyarea and @fig-catchdistplot). The main trend in the spatial distribution of haddock catches in 5a according to logbook entries is the increased proportion of catches caught in the north and northeast.
